The solution involves carefully reviewing and refining your Firebase security rules.  Ensure your rules precisely define which users have access to specific data and operations.  For example, instead of allowing all writes, you might only allow writes from authenticated users or users with specific roles.  The following code snippet shows an example of secure rules for a Realtime Database:

```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null", 
    ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == root.child('users').child(auth.uid).child('allowed').val()"
  }
}
```
Here the database is only readable by authenticated users and write access is restricted to users who are authenticated and have a corresponding entry in a 'users' node under their respective user ID indicating that writing is allowed.
