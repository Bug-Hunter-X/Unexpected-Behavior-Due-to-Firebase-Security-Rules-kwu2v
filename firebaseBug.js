The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the security rules are too permissive, leading to unexpected behavior or data breaches.  For instance, if you allow unauthenticated users to write to a database node, you may encounter unexpected data changes that are difficult to debug.  Another less obvious error is when the rules are too restrictive;  you might experience read or write errors without the specific error message indicating the rules are the problem.
